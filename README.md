## Intro

For this homework I chose to take a slightly different path from the assigned weather API. Since I am personally interested in aviation, I used an aviation weather API called CheckWX. My page looks and functions similarly to the intended page, however the information it presents is slightly different, and more geared towards pilots. Wind is giving as it's heading (direction) and speed in knots. Flight category signifies a general summary of the weather conditions based on the visibility and cloud altitude. 

#### VFR (Visual Flight Rules) 
Indicates high clouds and good visibility.

#### MVFR (Marginal VFR) 
Indicates that visual flight is possible but visibility is poor and clouds are marginally low. 

#### IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) 
Indicates clouds and visibility are too low for flight to be conducted by purely outside visual reference. 

#### LIFR (Low IFR)
Indicates clouds and visibility are extremely low, or almost none.

## Some Details

The website expects a 4 letter ICAO identifier code to retrieve data. Some good examples of airports to try out are: KLAX (Los Angeles International), KATL (Atlanta Hartsfield), KIAH (George Bush Intercontinental), KJFK (JFK), or EGLL (Heathrow Airport in London) as an international example. Note the codes that begin with Ks signify airports in the United States, while other countries use their own first letters.
